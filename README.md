Here I have developed the application which facilitates the user,

路 to create new vehicle registrations

路 to get all created vehicle registrations

路 to edit/update a created vehicle registration, and

路 to delete a created vehicle registration

And I have implemented a function in the backend called TypeIdentifier which determines the type (vintage, old or modern) of license number entered by the user.
{the TypeIdentifier function implementation is there inside VehicleServiceImpl file which is inside the service folder backend.} [TASK 1]

The function validatenumberplate which is inside the service folder VehicleServiceImpl file, validates the license number which is entered by the user.
